(Grazie Loyalty,” “we,” “us,” and/or “our”) provides users with the ability to earn points and rewards (collectively, “Rewards”) from various participating merchants through its website, <a href="http://www.grazieloyalty.com">http://www.grazieloyalty.com</a> (“Site”) and mobile and other software applications (collectively, the “Service(s)”) subject to the following Terms (as amended from time to time, the “Terms”) and the Privacy Policy located at <a href="privacy.html">http://www.grazieloyalty.com/privacy</a>.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms at any time without further notice. If we change these Terms in a material way, we will provide appropriate notice to you, and, for any change, will indicate the date of revision at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to abide by these or any future Terms, please stop using and accessing the Service.</p>
    <p><strong>These Terms contain a mandatory arbitration provision that requires that disputes be resolved in individual arbitration or small claims court proceedings.</strong></p>

If you choose to register for the Service, you agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service’s registration form. Registration data and certain other information about you are governed by our Privacy Policy. If you are under 13 years of age, you are not authorized to use the Service, with or without registering.

Such Rewards are made available directly by the relevant merchant providing such Reward (“Rewards Provider”) (and not Grazie Loyalty) and are redeemable solely for the applicable goods or services of the relevant Rewards Provider. The Rewards Provider, not Grazie Loyalty, is the provider of the Rewards and such goods and services and is solely responsible for redeeming any Rewards you obtain. Grazie Loyalty will have no liability if a Rewards Provider refuses or fails to honor any Reward. In addition, the following terms and conditions also apply to all Rewards:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Rewards cannot be used for taxes, tips or prior balances, unless permitted by the Rewards Provider.</li>
      <li>Neither Grazie Loyalty nor the Rewards Provider is responsible for malfunctioning, lost, or stolen cards.</li>
      <li>Reproduction or sale of any Reward is prohibited.</li>
      <li>Any attempted redemption not consistent with these Terms or any other restrictions imposed by the Rewards Provider or Grazie Loyalty (including any Reward-specific terms associated with a Reward) will render the Reward void.</li>
      <li>Rewards are void to the extent prohibited by law.</li>
      <li>Rewards may be applied only to the applicable products or services sold by the Rewards Provider that are the subject of such Rewards.</li>
      <li>Limit one (1) Reward per redemption. Only one Reward can be used per redemption unless otherwise specified by the Rewards Provider.</li>
    </ul>

By enabling third-party services within the Service, you are allowing us to pass your log-in information or other information (e.g., token authentication information) to these services for this purpose.
